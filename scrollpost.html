<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Activation">Activation</span></h3>
<p>To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. Doing so involves several steps and conditions.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Decipher_the_Writing">Decipher the Writing</span></h3>
<p>The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a <i>read magic </i>spell or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).
</p>
<p>Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Activate_the_Spell">Activate the Spell</span></h3>
<p>Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.
</p>
<p>To have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.
</p>
<ul><li> The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine). Arcane spellcasters ( wizards ,sorcerers, and bards) can only use scrolls containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined by his or her class.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The user must have the spell on his or her  class  list.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The user must have the requisite ability score .
</li></ul>
<p>If the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her  caster level  is at least equal to the spell’s  caster level , she can automatically activate the spell without a check. If she meets all three requirements but her own  caster level  is lower than the scroll spell’s  caster level , then she has to make a  caster level  check ( DC =scroll’s  caster level  + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she fails, she must make a  DC  5  Wisdom  check to avoid a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, below). A natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the modifiers.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Determine_Effect">Determine Effect</span></h3>
<p>A spell successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell prepared and cast the normal way. Assume the scroll spell’s  caster level  is always the minimum level required to cast the spell for the character who scribed the scroll (usually twice the spell’s level, minus 1), unless the caster specifically desires otherwise.
</p>
<p>The writing for an activated spell disappears from the scroll.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Scroll_Mishaps">Scroll Mishaps</span></h3>
<p>When a mishap occurs, the spell on the scroll has a reversed or harmful effect. Possible mishaps are given below.
</p>
<ul><li> A surge of uncontrolled magical energy deals 1d6 points of damage per  spell level  to the scroll user.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Spell strikes the scroll user or an ally instead of the intended target, or a random target nearby if the scroll user was the intended recipient.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Spell takes effect at some random location within spell range.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Spell’s effect on the target is contrary to the spell’s normal effect.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The scroll user suffers some minor but bizarre effect related to the spell in some way. Most such effects should last only as long as the original spell’s duration, or 2d10 minutes for instantaneous spells.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Some innocuous item or items appear in the spell’s area.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Spell has delayed effect. Sometime within the next 1d12 hours, the spell activates. If the scroll user was the intended recipient, the spell takes effect normally. If the user was not the intended recipient, the spell goes off in the general direction of the original recipient or target, up to the spell’s maximum range, if the target has moved away.
</li></ul>
<p>Several arcane spells are different in level for  sorcerers  and  wizards  than they are for  bards . Such spells appear on the table at the level appropriate to a  sorcerer  or  wizard  (considered the default because  bards  typically don’t involve themselves in scribing scrolls).
</p>
<p>Likewise, some divine spells are different in level for  clerics  and  druids  than they are for  paladins  and  rangers . Such spells appear at the level appropriate to a  cleric  or  druid  (considered the default because  paladins  and  rangers  typically don’t involve themselves in scribing scrolls).
</p>
<p>If a divine spell is cast at different levels by  clerics  and  druids , it appears at the level appropriate to a  cleric  (considered the default choice between  clerics  and  druids ).
</p>
<p>Many spells are either arcane or divine, depending on the  class  of the caster. Such spells appear on both lists at the level appropriate to the  class  of the arcane or divine caster.
