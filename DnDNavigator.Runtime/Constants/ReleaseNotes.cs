===============

Thank you for using DnD 3.5 Encyclopedia!  

I hope you enjoy the new UI.  The app has been completely rewritten from the ground up with several major enhancements.  

The new layout will hopefully make it easier to find and navigate between items as well as make it easier to gather the information you need.

A few features to check out (besides the new look):

* Searching across a specific set of categories is now possible
* Entries in Categories can be organized by specific attributes (E.g., Spells by Level, Monsters by Challenge Rating)
* More detailed info is available for lists of Entries rather than just the name
* The legacy full reference text can still be accessed via the app bar when viewing an Entry
* PREMIUM: Add Entries to Campaign Playlists via the app bar in an opened Entry!

   - Just $1 (USD) gets you access to be able to add any Entry to any number of Campaign Playlists you create.  As a DM, this feature is super useful and enables you to assemble a large portion of your game without having to search for each individual Entry or filter your favorites while the game is being played.  
** Owners of the Donate version of the app already have Premium unlocked.

 Cheers,
 FrannSoft";
